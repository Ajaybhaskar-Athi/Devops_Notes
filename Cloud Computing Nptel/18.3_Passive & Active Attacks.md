### Passive Attacks
- **Definition**: These attacks involve secretly observing or obtaining information without altering the data being transmitted.
- **Types**:
  1. **Release of Message Contents**: This means preventing an attacker from reading the actual content of the messages being sent.
  2. **Traffic Analysis**: Attackers analyse data to determine who is communicating, how often, and the size of messages, even if they can't read the actual content.

- **Detection**: Passive attacks are very difficult to detect since no changes are made to the data.

### Active Attacks
- **Definition**: These attacks involve actively tampering with the data being transmitted or creating fake data streams.
- **Categories**:
  1. **Masquerade**: An attacker pretends to be a legitimate user or entity.
  2. **Replay**: An attacker captures valid data and sends it again to trick the system.
  3. **Modification**: An attacker alters part of a legitimate message before sending it.
  4. **Denial of Service (DoS)**: An attacker prevents users from accessing a service or network.

- **Detection**: Active attacks can often be detected since they involve changes to the data or system behaviour

### Role of Security

A security infrastructure provides essential protections:

1. **Confidentiality**: Keeps private information safe from unauthorized access.

2. **Integrity**: Ensures that data remains accurate and unaltered.

3. **Availability**: Makes sure that services and data are accessible when needed, preventing denial of service.

4. **Authentication**: `Confirms the identity of legitimate users.`

5. **Authorization**: `Determines if a user has permission to perform a specific action.`

6. **Non-repudiation**: Ensures that actions can be traced, preventing individuals from denying their actions.

7. **Safety**: Protects against tampering, damage, and theft of assets.
