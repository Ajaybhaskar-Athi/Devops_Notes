**Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC)** refers to the combination of mobile computing and cloud computing technologies, enabling mobile devices to access cloud resources and services. This approach allows users to leverage the capabilities of cloud computing—such as storage, processing power, and applications—directly from their mobile devices.


# Dynamic Runtime Offloading:
 - refers to the process of transferring certain computational tasks or workloads from a mobile device (or edge device) to a cloud server or more powerful computing resources during the execution of an application. This technique is particularly useful in mobile and cloud computing environments, where devices often have limited processing power, battery life, and storage capacity.

 Dynamic runtime offloading involves several key issues:

1. **Dynamic Application Profiling and Solver on SMD**: Continuously analysing an application’s behaviour while it runs on a device to identify resource usage.

2. **Runtime Application Partitioning**: Dividing an application into smaller parts while it is running to manage resources more effectively.

3. **Migration of Intensive Components**: Moving resource-heavy parts of an application from a mobile device to a more powerful server or cloud to enhance performance.

4. **Continuous Synchronization for the Entire Duration of Runtime Execution**: Keeping all parts of an application up-to-date with each other in real-time as it runs, ensuring seamless operation.

# key components of **Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC)**:

### 1. Profiler
- **What it does**: Monitors application execution to collect data about execution time, power consumption, and network traffic.

### 2. Solver
- **What it does**: Determines which parts of an application should run on the mobile device and which should run in the cloud.

### 3. Synchronizer
- **What it does**: Collects the results from the split execution and combines them, ensuring that the execution details are transparent to the user.
