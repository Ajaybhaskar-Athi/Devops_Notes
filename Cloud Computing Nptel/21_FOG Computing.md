### Cloud Computing: Challenges

1. **Processing of Huge Data**:
   - Managing and processing large volumes of data in a data centre can be resource-intensive and complex, leading to performance bottlenecks.

2. **Data centre Configuration**:
   - Data centres can be either privately hosted by organizations (private cloud setup) or publicly available by paying rent (public cloud). Each configuration presents its own set of challenges, such as security, cost, and scalability.

3. **Data Upload Requirements**:
   - All necessary information must be uploaded to the cloud for processing and knowledge extraction, which can raise concerns about data transfer speeds, bandwidth usage, and potential data loss during migrationn.

# FOG computing

- Fog computing, also known as fogging/edge computing, it is a model in which data, processing and applications are concentrated in devices at the network edge rather than existing almost entirely in the cloud.
- The term "Fog Computing" was introduced by the Cisco Systems as new model to ease wireless data transfer to distributed devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) network paradigm
- CISCO's vision of fog computing is to enable applications on billions of connected devices to run directly at the network edge.
  - Users can develop, manage and run software applications on Cisco framework of networked devices, including hardened routers  and     switches.
  - Cisco brings the open source Linux and network operating system together in a single networked device

### Fog Computing Overview

Fog computing brings intelligence down from the cloud, placing it closer to the ground and end-users. Key aspects include:

- **Edge/Fog Devices**:    `Cellular base stations, network routers, and Wi-Fi gateways can run applications, allowing for localized data processing.`

- **Basic Processing**: `End devices, such as sensors, are equipped to perform basic data processing, reducing the need to send all data to the cloud.`

- **Reduced Response Time**:` Processing data close to the devices lowers response times, enabling real-time applications and enhancing user experiences.`

### Fog Computing - Motivation

-  Fog computing is a paradigm that extends cloud services to the edge of the network, bridging the gap between cloud computing and end-user devices.

- Fog provides data, compute storage, and application services directly to the end-user, enabling quicker access and processing.

- **Recent Developments**: The motivation for fog computing is driven by advancements in technologies such as smart grids, smart traffic lights, connected vehicles, and software-defined networks, all of which benefit from localized data processing and real-time responsiveness.
