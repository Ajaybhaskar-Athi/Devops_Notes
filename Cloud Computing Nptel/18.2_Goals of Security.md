# Goals of Security : 

 Prevention
  Prevent attackers from violating security policy
 Detection
 Detect attackers’ violation of security policy
 Recovery
 Stop attack, assess and repair damage
 Continue to function correctly even if attack succeds


# Types of Mechanisms: (secure,precise,Broad)

### 1. Secure Mechanisms
- **Purpose**: Protects data and systems from unauthorized access and attacks.
- **Key Features**: Confidentiality, integrity, availability.
- **Examples**: 
  - **Encryption**: Secures data by converting it into a coded format.
  - **Access Controls**: Restricts who can view or use resources.
  - **Firewalls**: Monitors and controls network traffic.

### 2. Precise Mechanisms
- **Purpose**: Ensures accuracy and specificity in processes or operations.
- **Key Features**: Exactness, clarity, consistency.
- **Examples**:
  - **Formal Verification**: Proves that systems work as intended.
  - **Type Checking**: Ensures consistent variable usage in programming.
  - **Error Detection**: Identifies and corrects errors in data.

### 3. Broad Mechanisms
- **Purpose**: Offers general solutions applicable across various scenarios.
- **Key Features**: Flexibility, comprehensiveness, interoperability.
- **Examples**:
  - **General-Purpose OS**: Supports various applications (e.g., Linux, Windows).
  - **Middleware**: Facilitates communication between different applications.
  - **Cloud Platforms**: Provides a range of services for different needs.
