Four types of attack:

1. Interruption
2. Interception
3. Modification
4. Fabrication

In the context of cybersecurity, the four types of attacks you've listed represent different methods through which attackers can compromise the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data and systems. Here's a brief overview of each type

### 1. Interruption (ÔÅÆ Attack on availability)

- **Definition**: This type of attack disrupts the normal functioning of a service, preventing legitimate users from accessing it.
- **Examples**: 
  - **Natural Disasters**: Events like floods or earthquakes that can physically damage data centres and disrupt service availability.
- **Impact**: Loss of availability, which can lead to financial losses and damage to reputation.

### 2. Interception(Attack on confidentiality)

- **Definition**: Involves unauthorized access to data while it is being transmitted over a network.

- **Impact**: Compromised confidentiality, leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.

### 3. Modification (Attack on integrity)

- **Definition**: This type of attack involves altering data in transit or stored data without authorization.
 - **Impact**: Compromised integrity, which can lead to incorrect data being used in decision-making, financial loss, or reputational damage.

### 4. Fabrication (Attack on authenticity)

- **Definition**: Involves creating false data or messages to deceive individuals or systems.

- **Impact**: Breach of trust, compromised systems, and potential financial or data loss due to reliance on false information.
