### Fog Computing - Not a Replacement for Cloud Computing

- **Purpose**: Fog or edge devices support cloud data centres to enhance response times for real-time applications, rather than replacing cloud computing. Effective handshaking between fog and cloud computing is essential.

- **Benefits of Fog Computing**:
  - Low latency and location awareness
  - Wide geographical distribution
  - Mobility support
  - Large number of nodes
  - Predominant use of wireless access
  - Strong presence of streaming and real-time applications
  - Heterogeneous environments

### Advantages of Fog Computing

- **Proximity to End Users**: Fog computing is closer to end-users than cloud computing.
- **Dense Geographical Distribution**: Fog nodes are widely distributed and support mobility.
- **Improved QoS and Real-Time Applications**: Offers low latency, location awareness, and enhances quality of service (QoS) for real-time applications.

### Security Issues in Fog Computing

- **Key Issues**: Authentication is essential at various gateway levels and within fog nodes.
  - **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: Potential for data interception.
  - **Privacy Issues**: Smart meters in smart grids, with individual IP addresses, can be tampered with or spoofed by malicious users, leading to false data reporting or or  unauthorized access.

### Limitations of Cloud Computing

- High bandwidth requirements
- Limited by client access links
- High latency
- Security concerns

#### Fog as a Solution

- **Reduced Data Movement**: Decreases network congestion.
- **Elimination of Bottlenecks**: Reduces issues associated with centralized computing.
- **Enhanced Security**: Data remains closer to end-users, improving security, especially when encrypted.
