Green Cloud refers to cloud computing strategies and practices aimed at reducing environmental impact by minimizing energy consumption, resource waste, and carbon footprint. It aligns with sustainability goals through methods like optimizing data center energy use, utilizing renewable energy sources, implementing efficient cooling systems, and designing software and hardware to work with minimal power consumption consumption.

The main benefits of Green Cloud include:
- **Lower carbon emissions** by reducing energy-intensive processes.
- **Cost savings** for cloud providers and consumers through energy-efficient practices.
- **Extended equipment lifecycle** by reducing hardware strain, which leads to less e-waste.
- **Support for sustainability** initiatives, often aligning with corporate social responsibility goals.

Green Cloud solutions are particularly relevant as data demands grow, providing ways to meet cloud computing needs while reducing environmental impact.


`In the context of Green Cloud Computing, the Power Usage Effectiveness is defined as (Overall Power / Power Delivered).`
