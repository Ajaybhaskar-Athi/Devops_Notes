A **federated cloud**, or **cloud federation**, is a setup where multiple cloud providers (internal and external) work together to meet different business needs. This means they share resources and services, allowing users to access a broader range of options and capabilities than any single provider could offer alone.

### Goals of Cloud Federation
- **Capacity Utilization**: Efficient use of resources across providers.
- **Interoperability**: Seamless collaboration among providers for smooth service access.
- **Service CatLog**: A wide range of services available from multiple providers.
- **Transparency and SLAs**: Clear information on providers, service options, and guaranteed performance (SLA - Service Level Agreement).

### Motivations for Federation
1. **Resource Optimization**: Maximize usage of available resources.
2. **Energy Efficiency**: Reduce power consumption by balancing workloads.
3. **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic effectively across multiple providers.
4. **Global Reach**: Increase provider footprint by reaching users worldwide.

### Types of Federations
- **Loosely Coupled Federation**: Providers share resources but operate mostly independently with minimal coordination.
- **Partially Coupled Federation**: Providers have a stronger connection with some coordination but retain separate management. 

Federations allow cloud providers to expand and users to benefit from a more resilient, flexible, and globally available service network.


`A key benefit of cloud federation is maximizing resource utilization and achieving effective load balancing across multiple CSPs (cloud service providers), improving efficiency and reliability through shared resources.`
