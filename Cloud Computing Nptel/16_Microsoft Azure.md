### Create an Azure App Service plan

 - An App Service plan specifies the location, size,and features of the web server farm that hosts your app. You can save money when hosting multiple apps by configuring the web apps to share a single App Service plan.
`App Service plans define:`

 Region (for example: North Europe, East US, or Southeast Asia)
 Instance size (small, medium, or large)
 Scale count (1 to 20 instances)
 SKU (Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, or Premium)

### Create a web app
The web app provides a hosting space for your code and provides a URL to
view the deployed app.
