# US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines Computing as:

**Cloud computing**  is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a
shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g. networks, servers, storage, applications,
and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or
service provider interaction. "


- there is a shared pool of resource which can be configured as per demand.
###                               Cloud Services Models

   **Business process as a service**
   Horizontal or vertical bus•ness processes provided on a subscription basis to compames or industries

Business Process as a Service (BPaaS) refers to the delivery of business process outsourcing services through the cloud. BPaaS enables organizations to use various business processes that are managed by third-party service providers and accessible via a web-based interface. This model allows companies to streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve efficiency without investing heavily in infrastructure.


   **Software as a Service (SaaS)**

The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications
are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface. such as a web browser (e.g., webbased email),
or a program interface.
The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems,
storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration
settings.

-• SaaS applications are designed for end users and are  delivered over the web

Ex:Google Spread Sheet, CRM ( Customer Relationship Management ),Billing Software

# Platform as a Service PaaS :

Provides a platform allowing developers to build and deploy applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
-• PaaS is the set of tools and services designed to make coding and deploying applications quickly and efficiently

Example: Google App Engine, which allows developers to deploy apps
without managing the hardware.

**Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** servers ,storages,databases
The capability provided to provision processing, storage, networks. and other fundamental computing resources
Consumer can deploy and run arbitrary software
• IaaS is the hardware and software that powers it all —
servers, storage, network, operating systems
eg: Amazon Web Services and Flexi scale.

#             virtualization in General

• Advantages of virtual machines:
— Run operating systems where the physical hardware is unavailable,
— Easier to create new machines, backup machines, etc.,
— Software testing using "clean" installs of operating systems and software,
— Emulate more machines than are physically available,
— Timeshare lightly loaded systems on one host,
— Debug problems (suspend and resume the problem machine),
— Easy migration of virtual machines (shutdown needed or not).
— Run legacy systems

#    Advantages of Cloud Computing

Lower computer costs:
— No need of a high-powered and high-priced computer to run cloud computing's
web. based applications.
— Since applications run in the cloud, not on the desktop PC, your desktop PC does not
need the processing power or hard disk space demanded by traditional desktop
software.
— When you are using web-based applications, your PC can be less expensive, with a
smaller hard disk, less memory, more efficient processor...
— In fact, your PC in this scenario does not even need a CD or DVD drive, as no
software programs have to be loaded and no document files need to be saved.


#    Disadvantages of Cloud Computing

- Requires a constant internet connection
Cloud computing is impossible if you cannot connect to the Internet.
Since you use the Internet to connect to both your applications and documents, if you do not
have an Internet connection you cannot access anything. even your own documents.
A dead Internet connection means no work and in areas where Internet connections are few or
inherently unreliable, this could be a deal-breaker.

- Does not work well with low-speed connections
— Similarly. a low-speed Internet connection, such as that found with dial-up services, makes
cloud computing painful at best and often impossible.
Web-based applications require a lot of bandwidth to download, as do large documents.


# What is XaaS in cloud computing?
“Anything as a service” (XaaS) describes a general category of services related to cloud computing and remote access.

xaas= Anything or Everything as a service

 **Service Models (XaaS)**

Combination of Service-Oriented Infrastructure (SOI) and cloud computing realizes to XaaS.

X as a Service (XaaS) is a generalization for cloud-related services
XaaS stands for "anything as a service" or "everything as a service"
XaaS refers to an increasing number of services that are delivered
over the Internet rather than provided locally or on-site
XaaS is the essence of cloud computing.



#   Service Models (XaaS)
• Most common examples of XaaS are
• Software as a Service (SaaS)
• Platform a Service (PaaS)
• Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

# Other examples of XaaS include
Business Process as a Servke (BPaaS)
Storage as a service (another SaaS)
Security as a service (SEWS)
Database as a service (DaaS)
Monitoring/management as a service (MaaS)
Communications, content and computing as a service (CaaS)
Identity as a service (IDaaS)
Backup as a service (BaaS)
Desktop as a service (DaaS)



#  Requirements of CSP (Cloud Service Provider)

Increase productivity
Increase end user satisfaction
Increase innovation
Increase agility


#           Classical Service Model


All the layers(H/W. Operating System, Development Tools, Applications) Managed by the Users
Initial IT budget and resources
Users bears the costs of the hardware, maintenance and
Each system is designed and funded tor a specific business activity: custom buildto-order
Systems are deployed as a vertical stack of -layers* which are tightly coupled, so no single
part can be easily replaced ot changed
Prevalent ot manual operations for provisioning, management
Result: Legacy IT
