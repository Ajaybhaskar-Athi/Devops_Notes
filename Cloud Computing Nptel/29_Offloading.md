Offloading is when tasks or data are moved from a central location to a closer, local device to improve performance and reduce load on the main servers. There are two main types:

1. **Offloading from User Device to Edge**: Moving tasks from a userâ€™s device (like a smartphone) to a nearby edge node, which has more power to handle them. This reduces strain on the device and speeds up processing.

2. **Offloading from Cloud to Edge**: Moving tasks from distant cloud servers to edge nodes closer to users, reducing the time it takes to process and deliver data or services. 

In both cases, offloading helps in faster processing, reduces network congestion, and makes better use of nearby resources.
