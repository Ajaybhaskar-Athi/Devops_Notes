The Service Placement Problem in Fog and Edge Computing is about deciding where to put services or applications on a network of nearby devices (like IoT gadgets or edge servers) to get the best performance . The goal is to:

1. Place services close to users to reduce delays.
2. Use limited resources efficiently.
3. Adapt to changing network and user conditions, like mobile devices.

Itâ€™s a balancing act between speed, resource limits, and cost.
