**Default Branches in Git**:

- **`main`**: The primary default branch for new repositories created on GitHub and many other platforms. It often represents the production-ready state of the code.
- **`master`**: The traditional default branch name in Git, used by older repositories. Many repositories have transitioned from `master` to `main`.

**Main Use of Branches**:

- **Isolation**: Branches allow you to work on different features or fixes in isolation from the main codebase, avoiding disruptions to the main branch.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple people can work on different branches simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.
- **Experimentation**: You can test new ideas or make changes in a branch without affecting the main codebase.
- **Version Control**: Branches help manage and organize different versions or releases of your code.



To create a new branch and switch to it in a single command, use:

```bash
git checkout -b [branch-name]
```

Additional branch-related commands:

- `git branch`: List all branches.
- `git branch [branch-name]`: Create a new branch without switching to it.
- `git checkout [branch-name]`: Switch to an existing branch.
- `git merge [branch-name]`: Merge changes from the specified branch into the current branch.
- `git branch -d [branch-name]`: Delete a local branch (only if it’s fully merged).


**Example: Developing a New Feature**
# Scenario
Imagine you're working on a project with a team of developers. The project has a main branch called main where the stable, production-ready code resides. Your team needs to add a new feature, and you want to manage this development process efficiently.

Steps
1. # Create a Branch for the Feature: `git checkout -b feature/user-profile`
When you start working on a new feature, you create a branch specifically for it. For example, if you’re adding a user profile feature, you might create a branch named **feature/user-profile**.

2. # Develop the Feature:
Make changes and add new code related to the user profile feature in the feature/user-profile branch. This allows you to work on the feature independently without affecting the main codebase.
 
3. # Collaborate and Review: `git push origin feature/user-profile`
If you’re working with a team, you might push your branch to a remote repository and create a pull request (PR) for code review. Team members can review the code, provide feedback, and request changes.

Create a pull request on your Git hosting platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) for the feature/user-profile branch.

4. # Merge the Feature:
` git checkout main`
`git merge feature/user-profile`

Once the feature is reviewed, tested, and approved, merge it into the main branch. This integration is often done through the pull request, which will automatically merge the changes if there are no conflicts.

5. # Deploy and Release:

After merging, the main branch now includes the new feature. This branch can be used to create releases or deploy the updated code to production.

6. # Clean Up:

Once the feature is merged and deployed, you can delete the feature branch to keep the repository clean and organized.
 `git branch -d feature/user-profile` : This command deletes the local branch named feature/user-profile
`git push origin --delete feature/user-profile`: This command deletes the remote branch named feature/user-profile from the repository hosted on the remote server (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).


Options:
**-d**: Deletes the branch but only if it has been fully merged into its upstream branch (e.g., main). If the branch has unmerged changes, Git will prevent deletion to avoid losing work.
To forcefully delete a branch that hasn’t been merged, use **-D** instead of -d.
