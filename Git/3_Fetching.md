The `git fetch` command is used to download commits, files, and references from a remote repository to your local repository without merging them into your local work. It updates your local copy of the remote branches but doesn't change your working directory.

Hereâ€™s what it does:

- Retrieves new changes (commits, branches, etc.) from the remote repository.
- Does **not** modify your working directory or current branch.
- Allows you to review the fetched changes before integrating them.

To integrate the changes into your current branch, you can use `git merge` or `git rebase` after fetching.

# .git/objects Created After Fetching

- As new data is fetched from the remote repository, Git creates new objects (blobs, trees, commits) in the local .git/objects directory.
- ` Each object is identified by a unique SHA-1 hash, which ensures that the data is consistent and integrity is maintained`
- After fetching, the new objects are stored in .git/objects, but your local references (like branches) are not updated immediately. Instead, they are updated in the refs directory (e.g., .git/refs/remotes/origin/) to track the state of the remote branches.

# STEPS:

1. git init
2. git remote add origin repo url # Add repo so in future its easy to pull or merge the fetched data
3. git fetch origin
4. git branch -r # list the branhces present in that fetched repo
5. cd .git/objects # navigate to local .git/objects directory where ur fethced data was there
6. ls # it lists the files avail in the .git/objects dir

` $ ls`
0a/ 17/ 24/ 32/ 43/ 46/ 57/ 76/ 85/ 91/ 98/ 9f/ ad/ d0/ e6/ f6/ pack/
0e/ 21/ 2e/ 35/ 45/ 54/ 5e/ 80/ 8d/ 96/ 9d/ ac/ c8/ dc/ ed/ info/ `
 `To know the SHA codes of the files navigate to that file using cd and run ls `

7. cd 0a
8. ls
   32c6b100a5d31e4635625f79798feOe7e687cf - some random code it will give this is the SHA-1 code of that

9. Git cat-file -t <sha-1 code of blob> # it will give the type of object
   `to run this command u make sure u r in 0a (whatever file) `
   ` And Add fileName+SHA code in above command => git cat-file -t 0a32c6b100a5d31e4635625f79798feOe7e687cf`

### Possible Outputs:

When you run the command, it will return the type of the object, which could be one of the following:

- **`blob`**: Represents file data (the content of a file).
- **`tree`**: Represents a directory structure and contains references to blobs and other trees.
- **`commit`**: Represents a commit in the repository, including metadata like author, timestamp, and a pointer to the tree object.
- **`tag`**: Represents an annotated tag that points to a commit.

### Example Usage:

If you have a SHA-1 hash like `a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0`, you would run:

```bash
git cat-file -t a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0
```

### Example Output:

If the SHA-1 corresponds to a blob object, the output would be:

```
blob
```

If it corresponds to a commit, the output would be:

```
commit
```

# In Git, a blob (short for "binary large object") refers to a specific type of object that represents the contents of a file. Here are the key points about blobs:

- Git cat-file -p <sha-1 code of blob> # it will give the contents of object
