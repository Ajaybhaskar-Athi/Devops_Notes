### GIT DIFF

The git diff command is used in Git to show the differences between changes in files, comparing different states of the repository. These differences are often referred to as "diffs," and the output highlights the changes made to files.

The `git diff` command is used in Git to show the differences between changes in files, comparing different states of the repository. These differences are often referred to as "diffs," and the output highlights the changes made to files.

### **Basic Uses of `git diff`:**

1. **Unstaged Changes (Working Directory vs. Last Commit):**
   Shows differences between the working directory and the last commit.

   ```bash
   git diff
   ```

2. **Staged Changes (Index vs. Last Commit):**
   Shows the differences between staged files (index) and the last commit.

   ```bash
   git diff --staged
   ```

3. **Between Two Commits:**
   Compares the differences between two specific commits.

   ```bash
   git diff commit1 commit2
   ```

4. **Changes for a Specific File:**
   Shows differences only for a specific file.

   ```bash
   git diff filename
   ```

5. **Changes Between Branches:**
   Compares changes between two branches.
   ```bash
   git diff branch1 branch2
   ```

### **Understanding the `-` and `+` Signs in `git diff`:**

- **`-` (Minus sign)**: Represents lines that were **removed** or **deleted**.
- **`+` (Plus sign)**: Represents lines that were **added** or **inserted**.

Here’s an example of `git diff` output:

```diff
diff --git a/file.txt b/file.txt
index e69de29..d95f3ad 100644
--- a/file.txt
+++ b/file.txt
@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
-This line was removed
+This line was added
 This line stayed the same
 Another unchanged line
+One more new line
```

In this example:

- The line starting with `-` (`-This line was removed`) was deleted.
- The lines starting with `+` (`+This line was added` and `+One more new line`) were added.

### **Additional Options for `git diff`:**

1. **Show Differences in a Unified Format:**
   You can control how many lines of context to show around the changes.

   ```bash
   git diff -U3
   ```

   This will show 3 lines of context around the changes.

2. **Ignore Whitespace Changes:**
   To avoid showing changes that only involve whitespace (like spaces or tabs).

   ```bash
   git diff -w
   ```

3. **Show Differences with Stat Summary:**
   Provides a summary of the number of files changed, insertions, and deletions.

   ```bash
   git diff --stat
   ```

4. **Show Word-by-Word Diff:**
   Instead of line-by-line differences, shows differences word by word (useful for minor text changes).

   ```bash
   git diff --word-diff
   ```

5. **Compare the Working Directory with a Specific Commit:**
   ```bash
   git diff commit_hash
   ```

### **Summary of Common Usage:**

- **Basic difference**: `git diff`
- **Staged changes**: `git diff --staged` or `git diff --cached`
- **Two commits**: `git diff commit1 commit2`
- **Specific file**: `git diff file.txt`
- **Word diff**: `git diff --word-diff`
- **Ignoring whitespace**: `git diff -w`

### GIT DIFF BREAKDOWN

In the output of `git diff`, the lines starting with `@@` represent **chunk headers**, which provide context about the lines in the diff. These chunk headers are often referred to as **hunks**, and they show the location of the changes within the file.

Here’s a breakdown of what each part means:

### **Example of a Chunk Header:**

```diff
@@ -1,4 +1,5 @@
```

In this example, the chunk header is `@@ -1,4 +1,5 @@`. Let's break it down:

1. **`-1,4`**:
   - The `-1` means the changes are from line 1 of the original file (the file before the changes).
   - The `4` indicates that the chunk covers **4 lines** in the original file.
2. **`+1,5`**:
   - The `+1` means the changes start from line 1 in the updated file (the file after the changes).
   - The `5` indicates that the chunk covers **5 lines** in the updated file.

### **Explanation of `-1` and `+1`:**

- **`-` (before)**: This refers to the line number in the **original file** (before the changes). The first number after the `-` (in this case `1`) indicates the starting line of the chunk in the original file.
- **`+` (after)**: This refers to the line number in the **new or updated file** (after the changes). The first number after the `+` (in this case `1`) indicates the starting line of the chunk in the updated file.

### **Change in Line Count:**

- If the number after the `+` is **greater** than the number after the `-` (like `+1,5` vs. `-1,4`), it indicates that **new lines were added** in this section.
- If the number after the `+` is **less** than the number after the `-`, it means that lines were **deleted**.

### **Example Breakdown:**

Let’s look at a specific diff:

```diff
@@ -2,3 +2,4 @@
-Line removed
 Line unchanged
+Line added
 Another unchanged line
```

1. **Chunk Header:**

   ```diff
   @@ -2,3 +2,4 @@
   ```

   - The chunk starts at line `2` in the original file, and it spans `3` lines (`-2,3`).
   - In the updated file, the chunk starts at line `2` and spans `4` lines (`+2,4`).

2. **Changes:**
   - The line `-Line removed` indicates a line that was **removed** in the new version.
   - The line `+Line added` indicates a line that was **added** in the new version.
   - The rest of the lines are unchanged.

### **Summary:**

- The numbers after `-` and `+` in the chunk header tell you where in the file the changes are happening (line numbers) and how many lines are involved.
- **`-1,4`**: This refers to the starting line and number of lines in the original file.
- **`+1,5`**: This refers to the starting line and number of lines in the updated file.

The `+` and `-` signs in the diff indicate **added** and **removed** lines in the code.
