This should give you a complete overview of the basic Git commands along with their syntax!



### What `origin` Means
`
In Git, the term `origin` is used as a default name for a remote repository. Here’s why and what it means:



- **Default Name**: `origin` is the default name given to the main remote repository when you clone a repository. It’s not mandatory to use this name, but it’s a convention widely followed.
- **Reference**: It serves as a shorthand reference to the URL of the remote repository you cloned from or are working with. 

### Custom Names

You can name remotes whatever you like. For example:

```bash
git remote add myrepo https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

In this case, `myrepo` replaces `origin` as the remote name, and you’d use `myrepo` in your Git commands instead.

Using `origin` is a convention, but it’s flexible and you can use different names if it better suits your workflow or setup.
