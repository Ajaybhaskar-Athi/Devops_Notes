**DevOps** is a set of practices that combine software development (**Dev**) and IT operations (**Ops**) to improve collaboration, automate processes, and enhance the speed and quality of software delivery. The goal is to shorten the development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

### Explanation:
- **Dev Team (Developers)**: They create applications and package them into containers (like Docker containers) to ensure the application runs consistently in any environment.
- **Ops Team (Operations)**: They download the container image, run it, and manage the deployment, scaling, and monitoring of the application in production.

### How Containers Make This Process Easy:
1. **Consistency Across Environments**: Containers ensure that the application runs the same way on a developer's local machine, in testing, and in production, eliminating the "it works on my machine" problem.
2. **Portability**: Containers are lightweight and portable, so they can run on any platform that supports containers, like on-premises servers or cloud services.
3. **Isolation**: Containers isolate applications and their dependencies, avoiding conflicts between different environments or applications.
4. **Scalability**: Containers make it easy to scale applications up or down quickly based on demand.

### Without Containers:
1. **Manual Configuration**: The Ops team would need to manually configure the environment for each application, installing the correct runtime, libraries, and dependencies.
2. **Inconsistencies**: Applications might behave differently in different environments due to configuration or dependency mismatches.
3. **Higher Costs**: More resources are required to manage, maintain, and debug environments. Scaling applications also becomes more complex.
4. **Longer Deployment Times**: The process of setting up environments, resolving dependencies, and debugging differences can significantly delay deployment.

### Summary:
Containers simplify the DevOps process by providing a consistent, portable, and isolated environment for running applications, allowing for faster and more reliable deployment across different environments.
