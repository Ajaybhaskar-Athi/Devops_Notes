# A Dockerfile
 is a text file containing a set of instructions to build a Docker image. These instructions define the base image, environment, dependencies, and any setup required for the application.

# A Docker image
 is created by executing the instructions in a **Dockerfile**. 
 - It is a packaged, executable version of the application that includes everything needed to run the software (like the code, runtime, libraries, and environment settings).
* # Why We Use Them:
**Dockerfile:** Provides a standardized way to describe how to build the Docker image, making it easy to recreate the environment anywhere.
**Docker image:** Once built from the Dockerfile, it allows the application to run consistently across various environments.


 # Example:
*You made a great chicken soup in Hyderabad and want your friend in Bangalore to taste it. Instead of sending the actual soup (like sharing a running application), you send the recipe (the Dockerfile). Your friend uses the recipe to create the soup (build the Docker image). This Docker image allows anyone to reproduce and run the same soup (application) anywhere, just like running containers.*
