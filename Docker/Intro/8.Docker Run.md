Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the different `docker run` commands and their usage:

### 1. **`docker run -d <image>`**  
- **`-d` (detached mode)**: Runs the container in the **background** and returns the container ID.
- The container starts, but you **won't see any output** in the terminal. It runs in the background.
- Use `docker container ls` to check if the container is running.
  
   Example:
   ```bash
   docker run -d ubuntu
   ```

### 2. **`docker run <image>`**  
- Runs the container in the **foreground**.  
- The container will start and **you'll see output** in the terminal. Once the command finishes or the container stops, the terminal will return to the prompt.
- If the container has a long-running process or interactive shell, you'll stay in the terminal.
  
   Example:
   ```bash
   docker run ubuntu
   ```

### 3. **`docker run -it <image>`**  
- **`-i` (interactive)**: Keeps **STDIN open** so you can interact with the container.
- **`-t` (TTY)**: Allocates a pseudo-terminal for a better interactive experience.
- Useful for running containers that you need to **interact with** (like starting a shell inside the container).
- With this, you'll be **inside** the container and can run commands interactively.
  
   Example:
   ```bash
   docker run -it ubuntu bash
   ```

### Summary of differences:

| Command                        | Mode         | Output/Behaviour |
|---------------------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| `docker run -d <image>`         | Detached     | Runs in the background (no output in terminal) |
| `docker run <image>`            | Foreground   | Runs and shows output in terminal (ends when process stops) |
| `docker run -it <image>`        | Interactive  | Opens an interactive shell inside the container |

You can choose which one to use based on whether you need background execution, immediate terminal output, or an interactive session.
