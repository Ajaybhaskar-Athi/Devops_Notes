### **🔹 What is a Docker Registry?**  

A **Docker Registry** is a **storage system** where **Docker images** are stored, shared, and distributed. It allows developers to **push (upload)** and **pull (download)** Docker images.  

---

### **🔹 Types of Docker Registries**
There are **two types** of Docker registries:  

1️⃣ **Public Docker Registry** (Anyone can access)  
   - **Docker Hub** → `hub.docker.com` (Default & most popular)  
   - **GitHub Container Registry** → `ghcr.io`  
   - **Google Container Registry (GCR)** → `gcr.io`  
   - **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)** → `aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com`  

2️⃣ **Private Docker Registry** (Restricted access)  
   - **Self-hosted registry** (Using `docker registry` service)  
   - **Private repositories on Docker Hub, AWS, GitHub, etc.**  

---

### **🔹 How Docker Registry Works?**
- **Pushing an image** → Upload a Docker image to the registry  
- **Pulling an image** → Download an image from the registry  
- **Tagging an image** → Assign a name and version to an image before pushing  

---

### **🔹 Commands to Use Docker Registry**
#### ✅ **1. Pull an Image from Docker Hub**
```sh
docker pull node
```
This downloads the latest `node` image from **Docker Hub**.

---

#### ✅ **2. Push an Image to Docker Hub**
If you have a **Docker Hub account**, push an image like this:  

**Step 1: Login to Docker Hub**
```sh
docker login
```
(Enter your **Docker Hub username & password**)

**Step 2: Tag the Image**  
```sh
docker tag myapp mydockerhubusername/myapp:v1
```

**Step 3: Push the Image**  
```sh
docker push mydockerhubusername/myapp:v1
```

Now, this image is available in **Docker Hub** under `mydockerhubusername/myapp:v1`.

---

#### ✅ **3. Pull an Image from a Private Registry**
If the image is in a **private registry**, log in first:  
```sh
docker login myprivateregistry.com
```
Then, pull the image:
```sh
docker pull myprivateregistry.com/myimage:v1
```

---

### **🔹 Self-Hosting a Docker Registry**
You can host your own **private registry** using:
```sh
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name myregistry registry:2
```
Then push images like:
```sh
docker tag myimage localhost:5000/myimage
docker push localhost:5000/myimage
```

---

### **🔥 Summary**
✔ A **Docker Registry** stores and distributes Docker images.  
✔ **Docker Hub** is the default public registry.  
✔ You can **push** and **pull** images from registries.  
✔ Private registries can be self-hosted or cloud-based (AWS ECR, GitHub Container Registry, etc.).
