**Port mapping** in Docker allows you to expose a containerâ€™s internal port to the outside world (the host machine) by associating it with a port on the host. This way, you can access services running inside the container from your local machine or external network.

### Why Port Mapping is Needed:
- **Isolated environment**: Containers run in isolated networks, so to interact with them (e.g., access a web server or database inside the container), you need to map the container's internal ports to the host machine's ports.
- **Access services**: You might have a service running inside the container (like a web server on port 80), but you need to access it on a different port on the host machine (e.g., port 8080).

### How Port Mapping Works:
- Docker maps a port from the container to a port on your host machine.
- Syntax: `-p <host_port>:<container_port>`

### Example:
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
  ```

- **Explanation**:
  - `8080` is the **host port** (on your machine).
  - `80` is the **container port** (the port inside the container where Nginx is running).
  - This means when you visit `localhost:8080` on your browser, it will forward the traffic to port `80` inside the container, where Nginx is running.

### Additional Options:
- **Multiple mappings**: You can map multiple ports:
  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 8080:80 -p 3306:3306 my_container
  ```
- **Random port**: You can let Docker choose a random available port on the host by leaving the host port empty:
  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 8080 my_container
  ```

### Why Use Port Mapping?
- **Access web services**: If you run a web server inside a container, you map the port so you can access the website from your host machine.
- **Access databases**: If you run a database like MySQL inside a container, you map its port (e.g., 3306) to a host port so you can access it from applications outside the container.
