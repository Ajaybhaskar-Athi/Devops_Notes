Sure! Here's a simplified list with every mode and command you requested:

- `docker run -d ubuntu`: Run container in detached mode (background), so that terminal will be free.
- `docker run ubuntu`: Run container in the foreground (interactive with output).
- `docker run -it ubuntu`: Run container in interactive mode with terminal (open a shell).
- `docker start <container_id_or_name>`: Start a previously stopped container.
- `docker container ls or docker ps`: List running containers.
- `docker container ls -a or docker ps -a`: List all containers, including stopped ones. (ps is meant by Process Status)
- `docker image ls or docker images`: List available Docker images on your machine.
- `docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> bash`: Open an interactive bash shell inside a running container.
- `docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> ls`: List files inside a running container.
- `docker stop <container_name_or_id>` : stop the container
- `docker rm <container_name_or_id>` : to remove the container
- `docker rmi <iimage_name_or_id>` : to remove the Image
